From theoretical aspect, this work gives a thorough explanation of mode collapse
and mode mixture by the regularity theory of optimal transportation developed by Figalli (2018
Fields medalist) and the reasons why standard GANs/VAEs cannot solve this problem perfectly.
(ii) From practical aspect, this work proposes a novel model called AE-OT, which first encodes
the data manifold into the latent space, then compute the Brenier potential to represent the optimal
transportation map in the latent space. The Figalliâ€™s singularity set can be located efficiently and
avoided when generating new samples. In this way, our model eliminates mode collapse and
mode mixture successfully. (iii) The algorithm for finding the Brenier potential and the optimal
transportation map can be accelerated with GPU based convex optimization algorithm. The method
converges to the unique global optimum with bounded error estimate. (iv) Our experiment results
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.
